# Play 2.1 

Play 2.1 is a high productivity Java and Scala Web application framework, integrating all components and API needed for modern Web application development. 

It is based on a lightweight stateless Web friendly architecture and features predictable and minimal resources consumption (CPU, Memory, Threads) for highly scalable applications thanks to its reactive model based on Iteratee IO.

## Installing

You first need to build Play:

```bash
$ cd framework/
$ ./build
> publish-local
```

Then, for convenience, add the framework installation directory to your system PATH.  
On UNIX systems, it would be something like:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/play2.1
```

On windows systems you'll need to set it in the global environment variables.

> If youâ€™re on UNIX, make sure that the play script is executable (otherwise do a chmod a+x play).

## Getting started

Enter any existing Play 2.1 application directory and use the `play` command to launch the development console:

```bash
$ cd ~/workspace/myApplication
$ play
```

You can also directly use `play run` to run the application:

```bash
$ cd ~/workspace/myApplication
$ play run
```

Use `play new yourNewApplication` to create a new application:

```bash
$ cd ~/workspace
$ play new myNewApplication
```

Once the application is created, use it as any existing application:

```bash
$ cd myNewApplication
$ play
```

## Running the sample applications

There are several samples applications included in the `samples/` directory. For example, to run the included Scala Hello World application:

```bash
$ cd ~/workspace/play2.1/samples/scala/helloworld/
$ play run
```
> The application will be available on port 9000.
